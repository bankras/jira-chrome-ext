# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

The team and community take security bugs in jira-chrome-ext seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/bankras/jira-chrome-ext/security/advisories/new) tab.

The team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the [npm contact form](https://www.npmjs.com/support) by selecting "I'm reporting a security vulnerability".

## Disclosure Policy

When the security team receives a security bug report, they will assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process. The role of primary handler is not always carried out by the same person.

The security team will work to fix the issue as soon as possible. Once a version has been released that fixes the issue, the security team will announce it on the release notes.

In the case of a security bug that was publicly disclosed (i.e., not first reported privately to the project maintainers), the process will be expedited to ensure a fix is available as soon as possible.
